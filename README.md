# App With State

here i'm trying to make a system for distributing application state information
to a all hosts on a small, simple network using broadcast ip. my hope is that
this system will be used in the AlloSphere and on Cuttlefish.

## dependencies

i use c++11, so you'll need a compiler that supports it.

## building

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./app
